# ABSTRACT

Fill in abstract at the end after we have finished the methods, results, discussion, conclusions and know what our data "says".

# BACKGROUND

Fill in some text here that provides background info on the WNV system, the blood meal DNA extractions, PCR, sequencing, etc. and the foundation for our question/hypothesis.

For example, we can use the viremia duration (Kumar et al., 2003) bar plot (make sure to reference sources!!!)  to illustrate the potential importance of house finches in WNV transmission and as the logical foundation for our hypothesis that house finches serve as amplifying hosts for WNV... and the prediction that locations with more house finches in our blood host analysis are also the same locations with higher positive tests for WNV in mosquito pools... 

NOTE: Examples of data you can plot for the background info at https://github.com/saarman/BIOL3070/

# STUDY QUESTION and HYPOTHESIS

## Questions  
Fill in here, the question we want to answer... e.g. What bird species is acting as WNV amplifying host in Salt Lake City?

## Hypothesis 
Fill in hypothesis... e.g. House finches are acting as important amplifying hosts of WNV in Salt Lake City.
  
## Prediction
Fill in prediction... e.g. If house finches are acting as important amplifying hosts, we predict that trapping locations where mosquitoes feed on house finches will also have higher rates of confirmed WNV in tested mosquito pools.

# MOTHODS

Fill in here, including overview of procedure and methods used for this project.

## Fill in first analysis
```{r first-analysis, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.width=4.75, fig.height=7}
# put code for analysis here
```



# Barplots of blood meal ID by trap locations with/without WNV positive mosquito pools

##Horizontal plots:
```{r horiz-plot,fig.align='left',fig.width=10,fig.height=7, warning=FALSE}
## import counts_matrix: data.frame with column 'loc_positives' (0/1) and host columns 'host_*'
counts_matrix <- read.csv("bloodmeal_plusWNV_for_BIOL3070.csv")

## 1) Identify host columns
host_cols <- grep("^host_", names(counts_matrix), value = TRUE)

if (length(host_cols) == 0) {
  stop("No columns matching '^host_' were found in counts_matrix.")
}

## 2) Ensure loc_positives is present and has both levels 0 and 1 where possible
counts_matrix$loc_positives <- factor(counts_matrix$loc_positives, levels = c(0, 1))

## 3) Aggregate host counts by loc_positives
agg <- stats::aggregate(
  counts_matrix[, host_cols, drop = FALSE],
  by = list(loc_positives = counts_matrix$loc_positives),
  FUN = function(x) sum(as.numeric(x), na.rm = TRUE)
)

## make sure both rows exist; if one is missing, add a zero row
need_levels <- setdiff(levels(counts_matrix$loc_positives), as.character(agg$loc_positives))
if (length(need_levels)) {
  zero_row <- as.list(rep(0, length(host_cols)))
  names(zero_row) <- host_cols
  for (lv in need_levels) {
    agg <- rbind(agg, c(lv, zero_row))
  }
  ## restore proper type
  agg$loc_positives <- factor(agg$loc_positives, levels = c("0","1"))
  ## coerce numeric host cols (they may have become character after rbind)
  for (hc in host_cols) agg[[hc]] <- as.numeric(agg[[hc]])
  agg <- agg[order(agg$loc_positives), , drop = FALSE]
}

## 4) Decide species order (overall abundance, descending)
overall <- colSums(agg[, host_cols, drop = FALSE], na.rm = TRUE)
host_order <- names(sort(overall, decreasing = TRUE))
species_labels <- rev(sub("^host_", "", host_order))  # nicer labels

## 5) Build count vectors for each panel in the SAME order
counts0 <- rev(as.numeric(agg[agg$loc_positives == 0, host_order, drop = TRUE]))
counts1 <- rev(as.numeric(agg[agg$loc_positives == 1, host_order, drop = TRUE]))

## 6) Colors: reuse your existing 'cols' if it exists and is long enough; otherwise generate
if (exists("cols") && length(cols) >= length(host_order)) {
  species_colors <- setNames(cols[seq_along(host_order)], species_labels)
} else {
  species_colors <- setNames(rainbow(length(host_order) + 10)[seq_along(host_order)], species_labels)
}

## 7) Shared x-limit for comparability
xmax <- max(c(counts0, counts1), na.rm = TRUE)
xmax <- if (is.finite(xmax)) xmax else 1
xlim_use <- c(0, xmax * 1.08)

## 8) Plot: two horizontal barplots with identical order and colors
op <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2),
          mar = c(4, 12, 3, 2),  # big left margin for species names
          xaxs = "i")           # a bit tighter axis padding

## Panel A: No WNV detected (loc_positives = 0)
barplot(height = counts0,
        names.arg = species_labels, 
        cex.names = .5,
        cex.axis = .5,
        col = rev(unname(species_colors[species_labels])),
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Bloodmeal counts",
        main = "Locations WNV (-)",
        xlim = xlim_use)

## Panel B: WNV detected (loc_positives = 1)
barplot(height = counts1,
        names.arg = species_labels, 
        cex.names = .5,
        cex.axis = .5,
        col = rev(unname(species_colors[species_labels])),
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Bloodmeal counts",
        main = "Locations WNV (+)",
        xlim = xlim_use)

par(op)

## Keep the colors mapping for reuse elsewhere
host_species_colors <- species_colors
```
